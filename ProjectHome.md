This code base seeks to add support for XBox live Friends to Adium.

Planned features include:
  * Displaying friends list in Adium with games being played
  * Sending/Receiving messages with Live friends.

**THIS HAS NOT YET BEEN IMPLEMENTED**

We plan to begin implementation after the May/Spring Dashboard update.
